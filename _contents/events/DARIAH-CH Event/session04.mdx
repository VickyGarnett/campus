## Abstract

In recent years, Digital Humanities' collaborative nature caused a wake
digitally-native research practice, where interdisciplinary workflows commonly
feed into centralized data repositories. Connecting these repositories, the
W3C’s Web Annotation specification builds upon Linked Data principles for
targeting any web resource or Linked Data entity with syntactic and semantic
annotation. However, today’s platform-centric infrastructure diminishes the
distinction between institutional and individuals’ data. This poses issues of
digital ownership, interoperability, and privacy of data stored on centralized
services. With Hyperwell, we aim to address these issues by introducing a novel
architecture that offers real-time, distributed synchronization of Web
Annotations, leveraging contemporary Peer-to-Peer technology. Extending the
Peer-to-Peer network, institutions provide Hyperwell gateways that bridge peers’
annotations into the common web. These gateways affirm a researcher’s
affiliation while acting as a mere mirror of researchers’ data and maintaining
digital ownership.
