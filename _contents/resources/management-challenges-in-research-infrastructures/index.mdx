This module looks at some of the key management issues that arise within
research infrastructures with a clarity and urgency they donâ€™t often have below
the infrastructural scale. It also looks at key trends and developments in these
areas, and how exemplar projects are applying them. In particular, this module
covers: User Engagement, Communications and Audiences, Sustainability, and the
Macro-level issues, including managing the political environment.
