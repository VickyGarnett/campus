abstract:
  Understanding how digitisation of legacy data and digital technologies
  involved in those processes is key for a critical appraisal of digital
  history.  This lesson examines the transformation of information from analogue
  to digital, using a collection of wire-recorded interviews conducted by
  psychologist David Boder in 1946 as a basis.

As historians, we are confronted with an abundance of data in digital form that
can be searched, annotated, analysed, presented and reused with the help of a
broad array of digital tools.

But what do we know about how digital technology affects the artefactual and
informational value of a source?

When looking through the lens of source criticism to digitized and digital born
sources, there are so many mediating processes going on before a source can
appear on our screen that historians run the risk of getting detached from the
original context of the source.

The basis of this lesson _David Boder: From Wire Recordings to Website_ are the
recordings that David Boder made in 1946 in order to preserve the history of the
Holocaust. These recordings of interviews conducted with a wire recorder were
made newly available when the interviews were digitised and published online
in 2009.

This lesson includes animations, a quiz and assignments to test your
understanding of the content.
