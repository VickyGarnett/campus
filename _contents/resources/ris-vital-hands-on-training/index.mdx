abstract:
  Building on an unusual interdisciplinary background that combined computer
  science and literature in equal measure, Frank Fischer found his place in the
  digital humanities. In this video, he explains how his background has enabled
  him to understand 'both sides' of a digital humanities project - i.e. the
  humanities and the technical. He discusses the distinction between formal and
  informal education, arguing that the more 'alternative' teaching methods used
  in the digital humanities (workshops, summer schools etc) are crucial in
  developing new skills. Finally, he discusses how research infrastructures are
  vital in providing this kind of hands-on training, since they synthesise the
  'social' and the 'technical'.

This is part of a series entitled 'What is the Role of Training and Education in
Research Infrastructures?'. DARIAH Director Toma Tasovac spoke to fellow
DARIAHns and colleagues from prospective DARIAH countries about their own
educational backgrounds and the role of training and education in digital
research infrastructures. The interviews show that there is no single
educational trajectory which produces DH scholars. The diversity of our
backgrounds is one of the main strengths of our field.
