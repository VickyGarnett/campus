abstract:
  In this lecture, Teresa Scassa examines the complex role of intellectual
  property(IP) rights in the creation and advancement of academic knowledge.
  While IP rights can create barriers to access, reuse and transparency, she
  argues, they can also further creativity and innovation by providing revenue,
  and by protecting other values such as privacy/confidentiality, and
  integrity/authenticity. IP rights can also, in some circumstances, protect
  against the exploitation of individuals and communities. Framing IP rights in
  terms of a sometimes complex web of relationships, this presentation asks what
  role IP rights should play in ethically open science.
