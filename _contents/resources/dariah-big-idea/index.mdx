Professor Jennifer Edmond, President of the Board of Directors of DARIAH-EU,
presents pathways to building sustainable infrastructure over time, future
directions for DARIAH, the humanities and arts in Europe and beyond. She asks
the audience to help DARIAH to think about what it means to be a European
reseach infrastructure.

This lecture was filmed during the Humanities, Arts and Culture Data Summit and
3rd DARIAH beyond Europe workshop, held at the National Library of Australia,
Canberra, in March 2019. The workshop is part of a series of three-day workshops
organised in the context of the DARIAH-DESIR project in 2018 and 2019, in the US
and Australia, allowing an exchange of ideas between the DARIAH community and
Digital Arts & Humanities projects in this international context.
