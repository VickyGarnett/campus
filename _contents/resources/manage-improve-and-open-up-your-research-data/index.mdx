This module looks at emerging trends and best practice in data management,
quality assessment and IPR issues. It looks at policies regarding data
management and their implementation, particularly in the framework of a Research
Infrastructure.

By the end of this module, you should be able to: understand and describe the
FAIR Principles and what they are used for; understand and describe what a Data
Management Plan is, and how they are used; understand and explain what Open
Data, Open Access and Open Science means for researchers; describe best
practices around data management; and understand and explain how Research
Infrastructures interact with and inform policy on issues around data
management.
