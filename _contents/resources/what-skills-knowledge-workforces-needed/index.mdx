What skills, knowledge and workforces are needed into the future? This panel
discusses interdisciplines and methods, emerging data practices and ‘Humanities
4.0’. It features presentations by Professor Jean Burgess (Director, Digital
Media Research Centre, Queensland University of Technology) on Digital methods
and the future of communication and media research and Professor Joy Damousi
FASSA FAHA (Lead Chief Investigator) on Future Humanities Workforce project and
by Associate Professor Mitchell Whitelaw (Australian National University).

The session was filmed during the Humanities, Arts and Culture Data Summit and
3rd DARIAH beyond Europe workshop, held at the National Library of Australia,
Canberra, in March 2019. The workshop is part of a series of three-day workshops
organised in the context of the DARIAH-DESIR project in 2018 and 2019, in the US
and Australia, allowing an exchange of ideas between the DARIAH community and
Digital Arts & Humanities projects in this international context.
