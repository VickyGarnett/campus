This course is an introduction to the theories, practices, and methods that are
used in the humanities for the encoding of texts for research, for preservation,
and for online distribution. It focuses on a particular method, that of text
encoding, using eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and a specialised schema
common to humanities research, The Text Encoding Language (TEI).

While there are other equally valid ways to store, preserve, and distribute
textual data (such as using a relational structure), this course will not cover
those methods. Rather, this course focuses on text encoding, its history and
uses. There are also practical hands-on exercises which allow students to
practice the theory learned.
