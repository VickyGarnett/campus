This module is dedicated to developing research questions in the Digital
Humanities (DH), especially on finding, working with, and contributing data to
digital collections and using digital Research Infrastructures (RIs). It will
show examples of how DH and eHeritage approaches in cooperation with relevant
RIs can lead to innovative research questions and methods.

The target audiences of this module are Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage
(CH) researchers and practitioners who wish to learn how to best benefit from
and work with digital collections using digital RIs. The module is also suitable
for computer scientists and researchers/practitioners in data centres who want
to gain insight into more humanities & cultural heritage related aspects of
digital research infrastructures.
