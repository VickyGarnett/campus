Open science has never been so high on the research agendas, and this is true in
all fields, ranging from so-called hard sciences to the humanities. In this

which has always been open by construction and fostering openness for projects
based upon its principles.

In this lecture from the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural
Heritage (ACDH-CH), Laurent Romary outlines the main issues related to open
science in the current scholarly landscape while showing how the Text Encoding
Initative (TEI) has been seminal in setting up an open agenda for managing,
