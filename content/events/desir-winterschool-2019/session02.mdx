## Abstract

In the Humanities domain, we see a broad diversity of perceptions on what constitutes scholarly data and such perceptions carry tacit assumptions that could and should define domain or discipline-specific approaches to research data sharing workflows. In this workshop, participants will be encouraged to examine their own scholarly practices and those of others, refining our responses to the fundamental question: “what are Humanities research data?” After a warm-up session dedicated to epistemological reflections on the role of data within humanities research, the session introduces the participants to the basics in research data management, data services and the FAIR principles in a humanities context. The aim is to see how all these at first potentially abstract new concepts enable researchers to conduct more effective research if they are well-translated into community practices.

Clearly, the generic research data management guidelines do not always align well with the cultural, conceptual and epistemological complexity of research data in the arts and humanities and the many entailments of this complexity, such as:

- Data in the humanities comes in a wide variety of source types, formats and corpus sizes. The word ‘data’ itself is hardly used and mostly replaced by the notion of primary sources;
- Researchers can lack know-how as to how to deal with the various dimensions of data management: documentation, hosting, identification or re-use conditions are not part of the education curricula in the humanities;
- A fundamental difference between the epistemic cultures of hard sciences and arts and humanities is that in the arts and humanities the wide range of scholarly information referred to as cultural heritage data are not autonomous products of research projects but are deeply embedded in the memory of the institutions (museums, libraries, archives) that preserve, curate and (co)produce them;
- These institutions are not only data providers, as ownership of heritage data is inherently shared between them, the researcher communities, the public, and the people and cultures that give rise to the objects in question.
- Access to and the digital availability of cultural heritage is the primary condition of research in the majority of humanities disciplines that defines the reusability and accessibility of scholarship built on them.

During the session, we are going to address these challenges one by one in the context of responsible open data sharing practices. Participants are encouraged to discuss data management issues related to their own projects (or project ideas) ideas and to contact the trainers beforehand.

Erzsébet started her job as Open Science Officer at DARIAH-EU in March 2018. She studied comparative literature studies, cultural studies and linguistics at the University of Szeged (Hungary) as well as at the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. She received her PhD in Cultural Linguistics summa cum laude in 2018 at Eötvös Loránd University for her corpus study of the evolution of certain Hungarian word-formation schemata. After graduating, she taught linguistics and Hungarian as foreign language at the Eötvös Loránd University as well as at the Fachhochschule Burgenland in Eisenstadt, Austria. In 2016, her commitment to democracy in science led her to join ScienceOpen, a research evaluation and discovery platform, as Content Integration Manager and open science advocate. Her role at DARIAH enables her to merge the 2 main pillars of her professional life: humanities and open science. She is responsible for fostering and implementing open science practices across DARIAH and its cooperating partners and contributes to the design and implementation of open science policy statements, guidelines and service related to the open dissemination of research results in the humanities
