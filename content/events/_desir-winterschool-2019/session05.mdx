## Abstract

As researchers, we are both creators of intellectual works and users of others' works. Copyright addresses the proper balance between the interests of creators and the possibility of reuse by the public. We will therefore look at principles of copyright and statutory licenses for research and education and investigate the provisions of the recent EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. In addition, we will discuss how Open licenses like Creative Commons work in theory and practice and how we can employ them to ensure both widespread re-use of our intellectual outputs and proper attribution.
