## Abstract

We present our method and interim results of the “Mining Goodreads” project,
aimed at developing a computational approach to measure reading absorption in
user-generated book reviews in English. Annotation of 600 texts showed the
difficulties in finding an agreement in the tagging of sentences. However, the
parallel work of five annotators offered the opportunity to distant read the
language used by reviewers when talking about absorption. Machine learning
approaches were applied on the annotated corpus, producing promising results.
