# Data Management Plan: Marie Puren &amp; Charles Riondet

## Abstract

_Research data management planning: a chance for Open Science. Methods and
tutorials to create a Data Management Plan_

With the growth of the Open Science movement in the past few years, researchers
have been increasingly encouraged by their home institutions, their funders, and
by the public, to share the data they produce. A new model of data sharing is
emerging, and this issue is becoming more and more crucial for the scientific
community and for national and international research policy. As shown by the
[OECD in 2007](http://www.oecd.org/science/sci-tech/38500813.pdf), public
granting agencies hope that publicly funded research projects would give access
to the data produced within their work, in order to provide new resources for
economic development. And with the extension of the Open Research Data Pilot in
Horizon 2020, H2020 beneficiaries have to make their research data
“[findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR)](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf)”,
and are therefore asked to provide a Data Management Plan (or DMP) to this end.

More than a constraint, this new model of openness brings direct benefits for
researchers. Sharing their data allows the researchers to organise and retrieve
them effectively, to ensure their security, to collaborate with fellow
researchers within the same discipline or from other disciplines, to reduce
costs by avoiding duplication of data collection, to make easier validation of
results, to increase the impact and visibility of their research outputs.

<Speakers>

**Marie Puren** and **Charles Riondet**, Ph.D., are junior researchers in
Digital Humanities at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and
Automation ([INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en)) in Paris, members of the
[Alpage laboratory](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/alpage-wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Accueil)
(INRIA – Paris Diderot University). As collaborators to the
[PARTHENOS](http://www.parthenos-project.eu/) H2020 project, they focus their
research on the development of standards for data management and research tools
in Arts and Humanities, and they currently work on the creation of a Data
Management Plan for this project.

Marie Puren also contributes to the [IPERION](http://www.iperionch.eu/) H2020
project, especially by upgrading its Data Management Plan. After being a
lecturer and a responsible for continuing education projects at the Ecole
nationale des chartes, Marie Puren has been a visiting lecturer in Digital
Humanities at the Paris Sciences et Lettres (PSL) Research University. Her main
publications belong to fields including intellectual history of the XXth
century, French studies and digital humanities. Marie Puren has been awarded a
Ph.D. in History at the Ecole nationale des chartes – Sorbonne University. She
holds Master’s degrees in History and Political Science from the Institut
d’Etudes Politiques de Paris, and in Digital Humanities from the Ecole nationale
des chartes.
