  Loup BERNARD is teaching at the University of Strasbourg since 2007. His work
  as an archaeologist on the Celtic settlements and territories in Provence and
  Southern Germany led him to develop an online GIS, ArkeoGIS. It is a
  multilingual, multichronological online and free tool. The platform allows the
  aggregation and querying of database extracts in order to share existing data
  between archaeologists and paleoenvironmentalists. After over a decade of use,
  ArkeoGIS has proved helpful for datasharing and linking open spatialized data
  and offers nowadays over 100 different datasets to professional researchers.
